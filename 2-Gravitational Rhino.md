## Description

When I went to the Zoo, I found my favorite animal. But I always wondered what this beautiful tank would look like on other planets, since it already weighs twice as much as some cars, it could give very funny values!

Knowing that we can calculate the weight of an object on another planet with this formula:
(see pic)
__All these calculation values are rounded up to hundredths (90.73 = 90.728)__

If we take the maximum potential weight of a white rhino and place it on Jupiter, what value will we get? Check here if you are a good engineer:
